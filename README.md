# 💻 Data Science Progress Repository
_Be one percent better everyday._

Hi! I'm Dleamnor Euraze Cawaling. I started this repository on Feb 8, 2024, with the goal of documenting my journey in becoming an effective and competent Data Scientist, dedicated to leveraging my skills and knowledge for meaningful contributions to this field. This repository contains a collection of projects, notebooks, and scripts that reflect my dedication to continuous learning and improvement in the field of data science.

I have created a roadmap outlining what I should learn as I dive into the field of Data Science, and I will continuously upload projects/notebooks related to these topics. My goal is to learn while sharing what I learn to fellow data enthusiast 🤝

## 💡 What to learn?

**🗃️ Web Scraping:**
This section contains web scraping projects for a single and multiple pages. 

**🗃️ Data Wrangling and Preprocessing:** (In Progress)

This section contains scripts and notebooks implementing data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering techniques. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features for machine learning models.

**🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** (In Progress)

This section contains Jupyter notebooks presenting exploratory data analysis of various datasets, including visualizations using popular libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to gain insights into the data.

**⚙️ Machine Learning Models:** (In Progress)

This section contains notebooks demonstrating the implementation of machine learning algorithms and evaluating the model's performance to understand the effectiveness of different algorithms.

**📝 Natural Language Processing (NLP):** (To be started)

This section contains text analysis projects demonstrating techniques such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and topic modeling. The projects may utilize libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, and TensorFlow.

**🤖 Deep Learning:** (To be started)

This section involves projects with deep learning models for tasks like image classification, object detection, or sequence prediction. It includes the implementation of neural networks using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

**📊 Data Visualization:** (In Progress)

This section includes interactive visualizations showcasing data trends, patterns, and correlations created using Microsoft Excel, PowerBi, or Tableau.

## How to Use This Repository:
Each project is organized into separate directories, making it easy to navigate and explore.
Feel free to dive into the code, experiment with the notebooks, and explore the datasets provided. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out to me directly. Please be informed that this is a work in progress so other folders may be empty for a given time. 

## Other things that I wanted to remind my future self and also you:
*"Never hold yourself back from trying something new just because you're afraid you won't be good enough. You'll never get the opportunity to do your best work if you're not willing to first do your worst and then let yourself learn and grow." - Lori Deschene*

*"Discipline Statement: Always do something every day that would bring me closer to my goal. Not only when I feel it but especially when I don’t." - Francis Kong*

All the best to you and thank you for checking my Data Science Repository!
